== Release Notes
1/2/2009 Ruby::XBee Version 1.0 

* *Prerequisites* - Ruby SerialPort
A platform-specific version of the Ruby SerialPort is a prerequisite for Ruby::XBee

The Linux/Intel, Mac OSX PPC and Mac OSX Intel versions of Ruby SerialPort are 
bundled in the Ruby::XBee package.

If needed for other platforms you can download Ruby SerialPort from:
http://rubyforge.org/projects/ruby-serialport/
and build from source.

* *Prerequisites* - Ruby 1.8.7
To date, all testing has been done using Ruby 1.8.7 (2008-8-11 patchlevel 72).  
No doubt, other versions of Ruby will work quite well, YMMV

== Configuring Ruby SerialPort symlink

A symlink should be created to point to the correct platform of ruby SerialPort.

For example, to run this on an Intel Mac, create a symlink to the intel mac version of 
ruby SerialPort:

  ln -s ruby-serial-port-0.6-osx-intel ruby-serialport-0.6

an ls -l should produce something like:

  lrwxr-xr-x   1 lcox  lcox     29 Dec 31 16:22 ruby-serialport-0.6 -> ruby-serialport-0.6-osx-intel
  drwxr-xr-x  14 lcox  lcox    476 Dec 27 22:09 ruby-serialport-0.6-linux-i386
  drwxr-xr-x  14 lcox  lcox    476 Jan  1 17:02 ruby-serialport-0.6-osx-intel
  drwxr-xr-x  15 lcox  lcox    510 Jan  1 17:07 ruby-serialport-0.6-ppc

== TODO
* need a volunteer to port Ruby::XBee to Windows - perhaps Cygwin or raw Windows cmd
* make Ruby::XBee into a gem
* Write a ruby utility to flash XBee firmware in order to alleviate the need to use X-CTU for that chore 
* Support XBee's API mode  - lots of new work to be done - major nice upgrade to get this in
* Support other XBee modules and firmware (ZNet, ZigBee, DigiNet) - lots of new work to be done

== Bugs

== Generating Ruby::XBee RDoc 

Ruby::XBee uses RDoc and the Hanna template.  To generate documentation yourself, you need
to do a one-time install of the hanna template and dependencies:

    sudo gem sources -a http://gems.github.com
    sudo gem install mislav-hanna

Then from within the ruby-xbee install directory run:

    hanna -U -x ruby-serialport-0.6 -x doc -x license
