#
# == Usage
#    xbeesend.rb [message]
#  
# example:
#      ./xbeesend.rb 'this is some data to send' 'some more data' 'last bits'
#
# each of the 3 parameters above is sent in succession.  You can put as many messages on the command
# line as will be accomodated by the shell.
#   
# example
#      ./xbeesend.rb
#       
# this form of the command will wait for you to input data from the keyboard...it reads stdin input
# and every line you type will be sent to/through the XBee when you hit enter 
#
# this utility can be used also for just setting up an XBee with raw AT commands. 
# it doesn't interpret anything in or out of the XBee.  You can put the XBee into attention by:
#      ./xbeesend.rb '+++'
# if you monitor it with the xbeelisten.rb utility, you'd see an 'OK' in response 
#
# See conf/xbeeconfig.rb for configuration defaults
#
# this code is for the following XBee modules:
# IEEEÂ® 802.15.4 OEM RF Modules by Digi International
